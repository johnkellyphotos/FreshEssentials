## Getting started

Fresh uses .htaccess and therefore is designed to be run on an Apache server. However, you can run it without .htaccess using the 'index.php' file in the app root directory to emulate .htaccess in non-Apache environments.

1. Open a new terminal on your device, navigate to the directory you want Fresh to be installed in on your machine. In most cases, this will be in your website's root folder.
2. run `git clone https://github.com/johnkellyphotos/FreshEssentials.git`.
3. run `chmod +x Fresh.sh` to add execute permissions to the Fresh shell script.
4. run `./Fresh.sh --create` to create a new project. This will create directories and a few files to get you started using Fresh.
