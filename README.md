# Fresh

Fresh is a lightweight, minimalistic PHP framework built using PHP 8.2 and Smarty 4. Fresh is a simple MVC style framework for PHP projects that is easy to use and understand.

## Getting started

1. Navigate to the directory you want Fresh to be installed in on your machine. In most cases, this will be in your website's root folder.
2. run `git init`.
3. run `git clone https://github.com/johnkellyphotos/FreshEssentials.git`.
4. run `chmod +x Fresh.sh` to add execute permissions to the Fresh shell script.
5. run `./Fresh.sh --create` to create a new project. This will create directories and a few files to get you started using Fresh.
